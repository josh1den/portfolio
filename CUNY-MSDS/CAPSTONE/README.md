<p align="center"><b>by Josh Iden</b></p>

## Summary
This study looks at data collected for 4180 movies representing the 200 movies per year by U.S. Box Office revenue between 2002-2022 and develops machine learning models to predict the box office revenue of movies. Data was collected using [Python](https://github.com/josh1den/portfolio/blob/main/CUNY-MSDS/CAPSTONE/PYTHON/movie_data.py) to web scrape data from [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) and [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/). Additional data was collected using the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). Data was cleaned in Python and R, with exploratory analysis and modeling conducted in R.
